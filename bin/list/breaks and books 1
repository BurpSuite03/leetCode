Twenty years ago, I met the most famous baker in the world.
I was in Paris for a speech, and visited Poilane, a bakery much smaller than its reputation would lead you to believe. I hoping to take home an unbaked kilo of dough, a sourdough, one that I could use to spawn hundreds of new loaves over the years.
Proudly of my sneakiness, I began ordering $30 worth loaves and tarts, And then offhandedly said, "and an unbaked loaf please." 
The clerks would have none of this. It was impossible, it wasn't done, it wasn't permitted.
Bluffing, i said, "I'm confident that M.Poilane would be okay with it."
On cue, a door behind the counter opened and a handsome man, dressed in a smock, came out to introduce himself. Even before he sopke, I could see the sparkle in his smile, and I figured we would hit it off.
Instead of shooing me away, he invited me into his office. We spent two or three hours together that day. talking about his work. He showed me his huge library of break and we hung out in the basement, where it was over 100 drgreees because of wood-burning ovens, he sent me home with 2 kilos of bunbaked dough. I kept that starter alive for years.
